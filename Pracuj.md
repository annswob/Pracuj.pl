## Introduction
Are you a foreigner looking for a job in Poland? If you are new here or still have problems with the Polish language (understandable, as it is one of the hardest in the world!), you might be searching for work on international platforms, such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm).

However, it is always a good idea to go local: that way, you can broaden your search and increase your chances of landing a better position. This user-friendly guide will help you to quickly install and use the application provided by [Pracuj.pl](https://www.pracuj.pl) – one of the biggest national platforms with job offers, available only in Polish.
